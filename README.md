### Project-2
     For the seocnd project, I embarked on the creation of an engaging game using the tkinter Graphical User Interface library.
    The primary goal was to assess the understanding of the material covered so far, emphasizing creativity, problem-solving, and coding skills.
    The challenge was to design a game that starts off simple yet progressively increases in complexity to keep the player entertained.
